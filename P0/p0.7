For this assignment i used the grep command to find the file in the kernel where the text "rodata_test:" was mentioned.
After performing the command grep -rin "rodata_test:" in the reptilian_kernel directory because that is where
i assumed the file was, i found out that it was in a directory called mm inside the reptilian_kernel directory and the file was called rodata_test.c.
I located where the string "all tests were successful" was because the inserted message had to be right after that which was before Detecting Android -x86
in the example screenshots. Also, i used the flags -irn too ignore case, search recursively (to expedite search), and to notify me which line the text
was at inside the file.

To edit the grub menu, i did the same command, but i did it in the root of the kernel because i could not find it inside the reptilian_kernel directory.
I searched for the string "Reptilian 19" by typing grep -irn "Reptilian 19" and i found it in /mnt/sysroot/grub/menu.lst. However, to edit this file, i had
to use sudo to give me superuser privileges because it kept saying permission denied when i would write to it.

The only problem I faced was figuring out the syntax for outputting the string because printf did not work. Upon doing some googling, i figured out
that using printk would work when debugging kernel files.

The way i tested my changes was my running the OS in debug mode and locating where the string "Detected Android x86" was at. If my text was above it, I
was done. Thankfully, i edited the right file and the change appeared where it was suppose to be. For the Grub menu testing, if my message was displayed
before entering the OS, I made the correct changes; testing it was pretty easy.
